    <h2>Sherlock Holmes Chapter One</h2> 
    <p class="description">Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is an action-adventure mystery video game in the Sherlock Holmes series developed by Frogwares. It is also the first game in the series to be self-published by Frogwares itself. Described as an "origin story", the game follows a young Sherlock Holmes as he investigates a mystery in his family's home on the Mediterranean island of Cordona after his mother's death. It is the first open world title in the series.</p>
    <p class="description">Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S 16 November 2021, with versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to follow later.</p>

    <h2>Half-Life: Alyx</h2></p>
    <p class="description">Half-Life: Alyx is a virtual reality first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve. It was released in 2020 for Windows and Linux with support for most PC-compatible VR headsets. Set between the events of Half-Life (1998) and Half-Life 2 (2004), players control Alyx Vance on a mission to seize a superweapon belonging to the alien Combine. Like previous Half-Life games, Alyx incorporates combat, puzzles, exploration and survival horror. Players use VR to interact with the environment and fight enemies, using "gravity gloves" to manipulate objects, similarly to the gravity gun from Half-Life 2.</p>
    <p class="description">The previous Half-Life game, Episode Two, was released in 2007 and ended on a cliffhanger. Valve made several attempts to develop further Half-Life games, but could not settle on a direction, and its flat management structure made it difficult for projects to gather momentum. In the mid-2010s, Valve began experimenting with VR, and released The Lab, a collection of VR minigames, in 2016. Recognizing the demand for a major VR game, they experimented with prototypes using their various intellectual properties such as Portal, and found that Half-Life best suited VR.</p>
    <p class="description">Half-Life: Alyx entered production using Valve's new Source 2 engine in 2016, with the largest team in Valve's history, including members of Campo Santo, a studio Valve acquired in 2018. VR affected almost every aspect of the design, including combat, movement, level design, and pacing. Valve initially planned to launch Alyx alongside its Index VR headset in 2019, but delayed it following internal feedback about the story by new writer Rob Yescombe; Erik Wolpaw and Jay Pinkerton rejoined Valve to rewrite it.</p>
    <p class="description">Half-Life: Alyx received acclaim for its graphics, voice acting, narrative, and atmosphere, and has been cited as VR's first killer app. It was nominated for numerous awards and won "Best VR/AR" at the 2020 Game Awards.</p>
