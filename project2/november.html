    <h2>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</h2> 
    <p>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is a 2019 action-adventure game developed by FromSoftware and published by Activision.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in March 2019 and for Stadia in October 2020.</p>
    <p>Gameplay is focused on stealth, exploration, and combat, with a particular emphasis on boss battles. The game takes place in a fictionalized Japan set during the Sengoku period and makes strong references to Buddhist mythology and philosophy. While creating the game, lead director Hidetaka Miyazaki wanted to create a new intellectual property (IP) that marked a departure from the Souls series of games also made by FromSoftware. The game looked to series such as The Mysterious Murasame Castle and Tenchu for inspiration.</p>
    <p>Sekiro was praised by critics, complimenting its gameplay and setting and compared it to the Souls games, although opinions on its difficulty were mixed.
