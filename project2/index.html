    <p class="description">Welcome to my Gaming Calendar for 2022! I decided that I hadn't played enough games last year so I'm determined to change that! Last year I bought a lot of games but for various reasons I never got around to beating them. This year I plan on beating a lot of my backlog and even playing some new games too!</p>
    <p class="description">On each page is a list of the games I'm going to play for that month along with a description of the game. I hope that through playing a wide variety of games that I increase my appreciation for video games as an art form as well as the amount of love that is put into each game.</p>
